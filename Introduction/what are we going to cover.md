what are we going to cover 

# understanding the architectures 
* vgg
*  resnet 
*  inception 

neural networks takes extremely large time to train 

## learning more about transfer learning 
taking the state of the art inception network and using it to predict on the dataset whihc it's never seen before 


## object detection 
we are going to look at the state of the art system which is SSD it's the prerequiste safety requirement of any self driving car 

## style transfer : 
we combine the content and the style fo the different images of various images 
here neural network can do it within seconds 

### the main point is what goes outside the neural network 
what can they do and what can we use them for taking most of their advantage
